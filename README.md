# Step 1
We use Apache Kafka. Download and install and familiarize yourself with it.  

Read a document on the techincal architecture of Kafka.  Compile a list of Kafka different features. How will Kafka be helpful to your project. Can you define high-level  software requirements/ software design  aspects of Kafka? You report this as a group? 

Individually, have Kafka  work with your dataset to stream your data to different sinks including an   SQL database ( later we will work with other databases).   Use of containers is allowed.  Configure Kafka to run on just one cluster for simplicity.

you submit a couple of page report with  a link to a  SHORT video screen recording  your process of installation and data ingestion.  You also show the Kafka features  that you worked with.   

Start as early as possible. This will take time. Do not leave it untill a couple of days before deadline.
